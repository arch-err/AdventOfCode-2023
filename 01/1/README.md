# Vim FTW

This solution is made in vim, so it's just written as a set of instructions that vim will run.

This is not Vimscript or VimL, this is just the same actions that I would perform in vim to manipulate the input data to get the answer. This can then be run by vim by using the following command:

```bash
$ vim input -s solution
```
